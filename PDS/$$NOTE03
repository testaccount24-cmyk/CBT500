Dear Sam,

It will work on both MVS 3.8 and MVS/zOS.
I didn't strip out the MVS 3.8j code. Internal checks determine
which environment ECF is running under and processes accordingly.

Thanks much, Sam!

Dear Ben,
Thanks for your amazing work.
One question:  If the previous File 500 is for MVS 3.8, and this
 one is for z/OS, then I would like to display both of them. So
 maybe they should be in two separate files. What is your take on
 that?
Thanks again for this gift.
All the best of everything to you and your family.
Sincerely,   Sam
