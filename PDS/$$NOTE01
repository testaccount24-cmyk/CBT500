Hi Sam,

For fun, I developed an automation product on my MVS 3.8j
(HERCULES) system that triggers CLIST/REXX scripts to execute
automation events. The started tasks recovery component (ECFSTC)
allows you to browse and update procedures that are preventing a
system from IPLing. It also allows you to issue most TSO commands
from the console. Please share it on the CBT tape. Let me know if
you have questions concerns.

Attached find the following zECF zipped text files:

ASM.TXT
MAC.TXT
INSTLIB.TXT
PARMLIB.TXT
CMDPROC.TXT

All the documentation can be found on the INSTLIB file.

    Follow the installation steps in INSTLIB($$INST)

    Review PARMLIB(ECFMSTR) subsystem initialization member. Note
    zECF implements SVC 255. Change it if needed.

    INSTLIB(ECF) is the started task JCL procedure used to start
    zECF.

    Review INSTLIB($$ECF) This explains how to start zECF during
    started task recovery situations.

    Run JCL procedure INSTLIB(ZZECFSSM) to assemble and link the
    product into your system.
