 Good morning, Sam. Hope you and yours are having a wonderful day.

 I fixed the pesky big!
 When you get a chance, please replace file 500 with zOS/ECF V2R2.

 Summary of enhancements for zOS/ECF Version 2 Release 2 (V2R2)

 1.  Added PC router routine ASM(ECFXPC) and ASM(ECFSAF) that
     implement RACF Security calls via RACROUTE REQUEST AUTH to
     secure all ECF subsystem commands and restricted SVC
     functions.

 2.  Added RACF security class ECFCLASS to support ECF commands
     protection. Job INSTLIB($$RACF) activates class ECFCLASS and
     defines its resource profiles. Implementation documentation
     can be found in member INSTLIB($$AUTH).

 3.  Added dynamic LPA (CSVDYLPA) ADD and REPLACE services in ECF
     service routine ASM(ECFCSA).

 4.  Added DISPLAY {OPTIONS | JCLPARM | STATUS | ISTATUS} ECF
     subsystem commands in command processor ASM(ECFCOM).

 5.  Documented additional diagnostic error WTO messages in
     member INSTLIB($$MSGS).

 6.  Enhanced ASM(ECFXPC) to allow callers to issue $TPROT PC.
     Unlike the TPROT instruction, ECF's $TPROT handles CC 3 and
     it's very fast.

 7.  Added ECF subsystem command prefix registration with the MVS
     Command Prefix Facility (CPF).   CPF makes sure the command
     prefix selected is not already in use by another subsystem
     in the system or sysplex.

 zOS/ECF release V2R2 resides in the following libraries:

 SYS1.ECF.V2R2M0.ASM
 SYS1.ECF.V2R2M0.CMDPROC
 SYS1.ECF.V2R2M0.INSTLIB
 SYS1.ECF.V2R2M0.MAC
 SYS1.ECF.V2R2M0.PARMLIB

 Best regards,
 -Ben
