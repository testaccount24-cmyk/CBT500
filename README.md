//*           This is a very, very sophisticated package. (SG)      *   FILE 500

//*           You can also profit from looking at the macro         *   FILE 500
//*           library.  It's worth looking at those macros for      *   FILE 500
//*           their own sake.  (SG)                                 *   FILE 500

//*     This product was adapted for z/OS as well as MVS 3.8j.      *   FILE 500
//*     It detects which environment it is operating in, and        *   FILE 500
//*     it acts accordingly.  See the members called $$NOTExx.      *   FILE 500

//*     For fun, I developed an automation product on my MVS        *   FILE 500
//*     3.8j (HERCULES) system that triggers CLIST/REXX scripts     *   FILE 500
//*     to execute automation events. The started tasks recovery    *   FILE 500
//*     component (ECFSTC) allows you to browse and update          *   FILE 500
//*     procedures that are preventing a system from IPLing. It     *   FILE 500
//*     also allows you to issue most TSO commands from the         *   FILE 500
//*     console.                                                    *   FILE 500
